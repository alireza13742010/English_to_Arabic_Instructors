# English_to_Arabic_Instructors
In this repository, the process of converting the English voice to Arabic voice is explained. This is a successful effort to combine already available models like Whipers with klaam to first understand the English language by voice convert it to the Arabic language using a translator, and finally convert the Arabic text into Arabic sounds. One of the main benefits of using this repository is the free and online availability of each subsection and the possibility of running the code with low-price GPU.
