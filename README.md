# English_to_Arabic_Instructors
In this repository the process of converting the English voice to Arabic voice is explained. This is an successfull effort to combine already avilable modle like Whipers with
klaam to first understand the English language from voice convert it to the Arabic language using translator and finally converting the Arabic text into Arabic sounds. One of the main benefit of using this repository is free and 
online avilability of each subsection and the possibility of runing the code with low price GPU.
